Great question! Let's break down the **difference between `permutations` and `combinations`** from Python’s `itertools` module with your example.

---

### 🎯 **Given**:

```python
nums = [10, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3]
p = 2
```

---

### 🔄 `itertools.permutations(nums, 2)`

* **Order matters**
* **No repetitions of elements in the same pair**
* Produces all possible **ordered** pairs of `2` distinct elements from `nums`.

Example outputs:

```python
(10, 1)
(10, 2)
(10, 7)
(10, 1)   # Yes, again because there are two 1s in nums
(10, 3)
(1, 10)
(1, 2)
...
```

* `(10, 1)` and `(1, 10)` are **different** permutations.

---

### 🔄 `itertools.combinations(nums, 2)`

* **Order does NOT matter**
* **No repetitions of elements in the same pair**
* Produces all possible **unordered** pairs of `2` distinct elements from `nums`.

Example outputs:

```python
(10, 1)
(10, 2)
(10, 7)
(10, 1)
(10, 3)
(1, 2)
(1, 7)
...
```

* `(10, 1)` and `(1, 10)` are considered **the same**, so only one appears.
* So, fewer results than permutations.

### 🧠 Summary:

| Feature                  | `permutations`        | `combinations`                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Order matters?           | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                             |
| Output size              | Larger                | Smaller                          |
| Duplicates allowed       | Based on input values | Based on input values            |
| Example (10,1) vs (1,10) | Treated as different  | Treated as same (only one shown) |

### 📌 Use Case in Your Problem:

If you're solving a **pair selection problem** (like minimizing difference in pairs), you usually want:

* **`combinations`**: when you only care about *which* elements are paired.
* **`permutations`**: when *order matters*, like assigning roles (e.g., first vs second in a race).

Great question! Let's break it down:

You asked:

> If I want to generate like `b`, `bb` — which one should I choose: **permutation** or **combination**?

---

### 🧠 Understanding the Goal

If you want to generate:

* All possible **strings formed using characters** like `b`, `bb`, `bbb`, `bcb`, `cbc`, etc., depending on the character set and length,
* or repeat characters like `b`, `bb`, `bbb`, etc.

You are actually doing something different from classical **permutations** or **combinations**.

### 🔍 What's the Difference?

| Concept             | Order Matters | Repetition Allowed | Example                            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Permutation**     | ✅ Yes         | ❌ (by default)     | `ab`, `ba`                         |
| **Combination**     | ❌ No          | ❌ (by default)     | `ab` (only one, not `ba`)          |
| **With Repetition** | ✅ or ❌        | ✅ Yes              | `aa`, `bb`, `ab`, `ba`, `aaa` etc. |

---

### ✅ For Your Case: You want **repetition and order**.

Examples like:
`b`, `bb`, `bbb`, `bc`, `cb`, `bcb`, etc.

So you should use:

> **Permutation with repetition**

---

### 🔧 Python Implementation Using `itertools.product`

```python
from itertools import product

chars = ['b', 'c']  # character set
max_len = 2         # max length of combinations

for length in range(1, max_len + 1):
    for p in product(chars, repeat=length):
        print(''.join(p))
```

#### Output:

```
b
c
bb
bc
cb
cc
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

| You want to generate      | Use                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `b`, `bb`, `bbb`, etc.    | **Permutations with repetition** |
| Unique sets without order | **Combination**                  |
| All orderings, no repeats | **Permutation**                  |

Let me know:

* Which characters you're using (e.g., only `'b'`? or `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`?)
* What max length of strings you want?

I can tailor the code exactly for your need.
🔹 ord() in Python:
The ord() function returns the ASCII (or Unicode) integer value of a given character.

| Function | Purpose                    | Example    | Output |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `ord()`  | Char → ASCII/Unicode value | `ord('a')` | 97     |
| `chr()`  | ASCII value → Character    | `chr(97)`  | `'a'`  |
